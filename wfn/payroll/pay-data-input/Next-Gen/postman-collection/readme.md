## Getting Started

To get started with the Postman collections you will need to download the Postman tool from getpostman.com/postman.

With Postman installed, you can clone this repository or download the individual files. You can then import the files into Postman and start making your requests.

The collection consists of a POST ACCESS TOKEN CALL, this call consists of two headers, **Client_ID** and **Client_Secret** you need to request the details from your ADP representative who will be assisting you in this process. Once you make a successful call, you will be recieving an access token, this will be used in making the API call.    

The Feature call (aka API call) are configured to authenticate using a Authorization-Token variable that is sent with the request header. The value is stored in a variable called as **accessToken-iat-wfn** and is automatically fetched once the user makes a successful ACCESS TOKEN CALL explained above.
